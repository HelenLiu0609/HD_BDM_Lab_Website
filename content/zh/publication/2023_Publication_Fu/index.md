abstract: This research examines the hypothesis that music experienced during puberty in early adolescence imprints on individuals to promote the pursuit of friendships and mating. We conducted an online survey with samples from the United States and China (Study 1) and a within-subject experiment (Study 2). Results suggest that most songs and poems identified as “favorites” were learned during early adolescence. Furthermore, compared with recently acquired songs and poems, those from early adolescence reminded participants more about friendship and induced more emotional reactions. In the Chinese sample, the shared preference for similar songs from early adolescence increased friendliness perception. Music from early adolescence also increased positive feelings more than other art forms, such as poems, fine arts, movies, dance, and views of natural scenery, especially when experienced in the company of friends than alone. In Study 2, singing songs from early adolescence (vs. those from recent years) enhanced the trustworthiness ratings of faces of the opposite sex and promoted intentions to cooperate. However, early adolescent music did not facilitate mating-related evaluations such as the ratings of facial attractiveness and artistic intelligence. The present two studies provide evidence that early adolescent songs learned during puberty possess imprinting-like effects on friendship formation and trust-building.
