abstract: Food, money, and time are exchangeable resources essential for survival and reproduction. Individuals live within finite budgets of these resources and make tradeoffs between money and time when making intertemporal choices between an immediate smaller reward and a delayed lager reward. In this paper, I examine signaling functions of blood glucose in regulating behaviors related to resource regulations beyond caloric metabolisms. These behavioral regulations include choices between energy expenditure and energy conservation, monetary intertemporal choices, and self-control in overcoming temptations. I begin by comparing potential embodied signals for resource forecasting and proactive decision making in terms of their pros and cons as a signal for regulating both metabolism and behavioral decision making and self-control. Based on this analysis, circulating glucose emerges as not only the designated fuel for brain metabolism but also a privileged resource forecasting signal for regulating immediate, short-term, and long-term behavioral adaptations to the resource budget of the decision maker. In the context of an on-going debate between the limited resource model and the motivation accounts of behavioral effects of blood glucose, I propose a dual functions (caloric provision and resource forecasting) and dual signaling (glucose taste and ingestion) hypothesis of circulating glucose in resource management, and provide behavioral and neurophysiological evidence of the separate effects of glucose taste to motivate effort for resource acquisition and glucose ingestion to promote resource conservation and future orientation. Accumulating evidence indicates that the body is able to detect fake signals of non-caloric sweeteners and react to such “caloric crisis” with an enhanced preference for immediate rewards over future rewards, revealing the wisdom of the body.
