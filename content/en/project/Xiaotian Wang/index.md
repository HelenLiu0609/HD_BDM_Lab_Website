I'm a professor and the director of the Applied Psychology program at the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen), a fellow of the Psychonomic Society, and a "high-level foreign expert" endorsed by the People's Government of Shenzhen Municipality. I'm also a professor emeritus at the University of South Dakota. I was a visiting or adjunct professor at Peking University, China Europe International Business School, Max Planck Institute in Berlin, Germany, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, and Singapore Management University.
