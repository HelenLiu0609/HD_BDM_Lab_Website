I'm currently a Ph.D student in Applied Psychology at the Chinese University of Hong Kong-Shenzhen. My research focuses on self-relatedness and social decision-making. I'm intended to use some cognitive models, such as the sequential sampling model or reinforcement learning models to expore the cognitive processes underlying behavioral decision making.
