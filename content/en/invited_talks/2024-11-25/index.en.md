Time passes swiftly. In 2024, the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) celebrates its 10th anniversary. In this moment of celebration, the faculty has launched a special series of interviews with key figures. Over the past decade, what changes and developments have taken place at the faculty? What are its goals and plans for the next decade? Let us follow the professors' footsteps as we reflect on the past and look to the future. In this issue, we are honored to invite Professor Wang Xiaotian to share his thoughts and insights.

### From Nothing to Something, Gradually Perfecting

Q: Why did you choose to join the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen)?
A: I came to The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) in 2018. At that time, I was invited to establish a psychology program, which was very exciting for me. The unique positioning of the university attracted me, particularly its global vision, English-taught courses, focus on general education, and emphasis on cultural cultivation. I believe that very few universities in China can fully implement these four aspects, and The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Shenzhen) does this exceptionally well.

Among research universities in China, our school stands out with vast potential. Recognizing this educational philosophy, I decided to join the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, with the initial goal of creating a psychology program grounded in China but with an international perspective. Since then, as the founding department head, my colleagues and I have worked together to successfully establish an integrated psychology curriculum at the undergraduate, master's, and doctoral levels.

Q: During your time here, what significant developments and changes have you observed in the faculty over the past ten years? What distinctive features and advantages do you think the Applied Psychology program at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences has?
A: Over the past ten years, the faculty has undergone a significant transformation from nothing to something, which I consider the most important milestone. I believe that an excellent university should cultivate three key abilities in students: scientific methods, critical thinking, and independent character. The purpose of university education is to provide a space for young people to grow, allowing them to enrich themselves and find themselves before entering society. We aim to cultivate not just "knowledgeable" individuals, but intellectuals with deep cultural foundation and independent character. In the era of big data, acquiring information has become easy, but true scholarship lies in understanding and applying this knowledge.

I believe our undergraduates are excellent, with a high overall quality. The Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences provides the entire university with English-taught courses and general education, both of which hold a significant place in our university culture. Our Applied Psychology courses are framed around holistic development, covering fields like developmental psychology, educational psychology, and career development, with an emphasis on cultural heritage and the integration of liberal arts and sciences. In terms of curriculum design, we focus on the integration of theory and practice. Students are required not only to complete core courses but also to participate in experimental papers, lab activities, community projects, or internships at schools. In the past five years, we have established about nine labs, including the Child Behavior Observation Lab, Cognitive and Behavioral Research Lab, Virtual Reality Lab, Near-Infrared Spectroscopy Imaging Lab, and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Lab. These labs have provided rich research opportunities for various research teams. These developments have made our academic foundation more solid and provided students with broader practical platforms.

Q: What aspects of the faculty have left a strong impression on you since you joined?
A: The continuous development of the faculty excites me greatly. As a teacher, it is a privilege to work with young students. Their energy and intellectual challenges constantly inspire me, prompting me to engage in self-learning while building a relationship of mutual teaching and learning with them. As teachers, we need to learn from the masters, from our colleagues, and from our students, continually enriching and perfecting ourselves. Our role is not only to impart knowledge but also to help students grow, becoming their mentors and friends, and ultimately fostering a cooperative relationship. I am particularly impressed by the students I have taught. Their excellence and humility give me great satisfaction. For instance, one student sent me an email before studying abroad in the U.S., thanking me for my guidance, without mentioning her acceptance into Harvard University. Another student, studying in the UK, mentioned how the democratic atmosphere at our school had been instrumental in his development. These small details have deeply reminded me of the importance of leading by example.

### Maintaining Curiosity, Focusing on Passion

Q: Over the past nine years, has your teaching philosophy changed as your experience has grown?
A: Over the past nine years, I have accumulated many insights in teaching and work. My teaching philosophy follows Confucius's idea of "teaching without discrimination," which has profound implications in the education field: education should not tolerate any form of discrimination, ensuring every student has equal access to educational opportunities.

In specific teaching practices, my philosophy is simpler: "Let curiosity guide you throughout." Why is curiosity so important? Because it helps us overcome utilitarianism, thereby reducing anxiety and pressure from competition. Guided by curiosity, we can learn how to become experts in our fields. According to the "10,000-hour rule," if you devote enough time and effort, you can become an expert. However, even after becoming an expert, we must continue to move forward with curiosity, expanding our vision and collaboration skills.

Q: You have extensive experience in interdisciplinary research. What importance do you think communication between different disciplines has for research innovation?
A: Personally, I transitioned from medicine to psychology, driven by curiosity. By exploring knowledge from multiple disciplines, I discovered my passion for psychology. This interdisciplinary interest was not deliberate but a natural result. The definitions of different disciplines are often external, but our interests and curiosity should not be limited by them. For example, someone researching AI might realize the importance of psychology in application design and data processing and thus begin to incorporate psychology into their work. Similarly, people with a humanities background can create new research perspectives by combining psychology with anthropology or sociology. While interdisciplinary integration may not immediately yield significant results, it can bring long-term benefits. My medical background allows me to quickly catch up in fields like biopsychology and neuroscience, which helps me better understand and address real-world issues. However, as we grow older, we often fall into the "adult trap," where initial enthusiasm and goals are replaced by mere financial gain, and work becomes driven by its rewards. This shift can cause us to lose interest in our work. Successful businesses thrive by loving their products and striving for excellence, which ultimately leads to profit. Therefore, interdisciplinary work should not be pursued for its own sake but because curiosity keeps us focused on refining our own field and passions, guiding us to explore and grow within complex knowledge systems.

Q: What advice do you have for students conducting social science research?
A: For students doing social science research, my advice is to approach it with curiosity, following your inner feelings. At the same time, it is crucial to maintain a calm mindset. History teaches us that it is not heroes who create the times, but the times that create heroes. Therefore, you don't need to worry too much about whether you can change the world. Instead, focus on doing what you love in the ordinary moments and prepare yourself for the right opportunities. To do this, first lower your utilitarian mindset. Through continuous learning, cultivate the habit of lifelong learning. Students should focus on one or two fields, digging deep and making long-term investments to become experts. Additionally, patience with solitude is key. Students need to maintain interest in their research, enjoying the process rather than being distracted by external temptations. Today, technologies like AI and virtual reality are highly attractive, but becoming immersed in the virtual world can weaken our focus and motivation and even affect our social interactions. Therefore, cultivating self-discipline is essential. Students should learn to find useful information for themselves and relax at appropriate times, but avoid indulgence—learn to relax without overindulging. In short, maintaining curiosity, a calm mindset, and self-discipline will help you progress further on the road to personal growth.

### Taking the Best from Each Discipline

Q: How do you view the impact of emerging technologies (such as AI) on psychology research and applications?
A: Emerging technologies, especially AI and genetic technology, are rapidly changing our world. The development of these technologies is human-centered, and understanding humanity is the foundation for effectively applying these technologies. AI's characteristic is that it "knows others but not itself," lacking self-awareness, which means we need to explore how to interact effectively and beneficially with this emerging intelligence. AI brings convenience but also generates much uncertainty. In this consumer era, society encourages innovation, but it also heightens anxiety about the future. With rapid technological development, many traditional enterprises face the risk of being eliminated, leading to increased anxiety. This uncertainty, in turn, makes psychology an increasingly important discipline, helping people cope with anxiety and change.

Moreover, the application of psychology must be based on an in-depth understanding of human behavior. Whether in experimental economics in finance or behavioral big data analysis, the integration of psychology with these fast-developing fields is crucial. We are in an era that requires "collaboration between the left and right brain," with AI considered the "third brain" in information processing and feedback, playing an important role and introducing new challenges, such as how to filter and process information overload. As these new technologies develop, the value of psychology will become even more prominent. If humanity can master these technologies without being overwhelmed by them, we can guide their development and avoid the risks that come with them.
Therefore, psychology must continuously evolve to keep pace with these changes, combining emerging technologies with deep understanding of human behavior.
