Acta Psychologica Sinica


In today's rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) technology, human society is facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The "Looking Forward to the Future" series of forums initiated by the top domestic journal Acta Psychologica Sinica successfully held an online academic lecture on the evening of April 28, 2024. Professor Wang was invited to be the keynote speaker. The theme was "AI Uncertainty and Psychology in the Information Age." The lecture was chaired by Professor Fu Xiaolan, editor-in-chief of Acta Psychologica Sinica and director of the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who also interacted with the live audience in a discussion.

In the lecture, Professor Wang first discussed the characteristics of the AI era, including the contradiction between massive information and human cognitive limitations, the limitations of high uncertainty and probability, the arrogance of rationality, and the limitations of scientific thinking, and the contradiction between technological progress and evolutionary design. He emphasized that psychology plays a crucial role in understanding and managing AI. Intelligent management of AI requires not only a deep understanding of AI itself but also an understanding of the differences between AI and human rationality. Professor Wang shared the empirical research results of his recent study on risk decision-making between ChatGPT and humans, and discussed in detail the similarities and differences between AI and humans in risk decision-making.

Professor Fu highly praised Professor Wang's report and hosted a lively interactive discussion with over five thousand online audience members, further enriching the content of the lecture and providing multidimensional analysis and thinking for the intersection and integration of psychology and AI.
