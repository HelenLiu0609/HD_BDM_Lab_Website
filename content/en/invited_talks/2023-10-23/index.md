Whether you are hesitating to buy a high-priced item on sale in a store or feeling the urge to buy a stock when it falls below your set psychological price level in the stock market, there is a common and powerful psychological phenomenon at play: the anchoring effect. It pervades our daily lives, shopping decisions, and investment behaviors. Why can the original price tag of a product attract purchases? Why do investors make irrational decisions anchored to a stock's historical price? How can one identify and counteract this bias? This episode will reveal to you that the first number you hear can become your decision-making "anchor," but it may not necessarily be the most rational choice.
