On the afternoon of April 13, 2024, Professor Wang was invited to present a special talk titled "Psychology: Integration and Intersection—My Interdisciplinary and Original Research" at the "Century of Hundred Psychologists" lecture series in China.

The series of lectures is organized by Guangxi Normal University, with the Education Department of the same university taking charge of the execution, and has received significant support and assistance from the Guangxi Normal University Press and the Guangxi Psychological Society. The aim of these lectures is to invite distinguished psychologists recognized by the Chinese Psychological Society to share their landmark achievements in the field of psychological research and discuss their academic growth and scholarly insights.

During the lecture, Professor Wang reviewed his academic journey, including the rich empirical experience he accumulated in both basic and applied research, and provided a perspective on the future development of the discipline. He particularly highlighted several important lines of his research, including the AA hypothesis of decisions biases,the Tri-reference point theory, the Signaling Hypothesis of Blood glucose and the Adaptive Life-span Management theory.

The lecture was concluded with a summary by Professor Zhang Jijia. Professor Zhang emphasized that Professor Wang was also among the first to introduce evolutionary theory into the study of behavioral decision-making, contributing significantly to the dissemination of evolutionary psychology in China. Professor Zhang also specifically mentioned four valuable experiences in academic research: firstly, a solid disciplinary foundation is a prerequisite for integration and interdisciplinary research; secondly, profound humanistic care is an indispensable motivation for studying human behavior; thirdly, engaging in interdisciplinary and integrative research can promote academic innovation; and lastly, maintaining a sustained interest and attention to theory is key to exploring the deep-seated causes of human behavior.
Professor Wang’s talk not only showcased his profound expertise in the field of psychology and his innovative spirit in interdisciplinary research but also provided attendees with new perspectives for understanding and exploring human decision-making.
