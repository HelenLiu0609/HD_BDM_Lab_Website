Annual Meeting Overview 

Join 3,000+ of your colleagues from over 60 countries at the Psychonomic Society's 2022 Annual Meeting in Boston, Massachusetts, USA, and online. The meeting will be a hybrid event, with options for participating in person in Boston or online. Attendees should register for either the in-person meeting or the online meeting. In-person meeting attendees will also be given access to the online program.

All attendees are asked to register by October 20th if at all possible. While on-site registration will be available in Boston, registering by the early registration deadline of October 20th will significantly increase the speed of your check-in process once on-site. It will also help cut down on registration times for all attendees. For more information, visit: https://www.psychonomic.org/page/2022AnnualMeeting
