      <description>&lt;p&gt;From October 25 to 26, 2024, the Chinese Psychological Society’s Decision Psychology Committee hosted the National Symposium on Teaching Materials for Decision Psychology and the 2nd Doctoral Forum on “Decision-Making Behavior” in Guangzhou, Guangdong. As an expert in behavioral decision research, Professor Wang was invited to deliver a keynote address titled “Behavioral Decision-Making in the AI Era,” which drew significant interest and enthusiastic responses from attendees.
In his presentation, Professor Wang delved into the profound impact of artificial intelligence (AI) technology on human decision-making behaviors, examining the opportunities and challenges brought by AI. He highlighted that as AI technology advances rapidly, research in decision psychology will increasingly become embedded in everyday life and society, broadening its practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Acta Psychologica Sinica&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In today&amp;rsquo;s rapidly advancing artificial intelligence (AI) technology, human society is facing unprecedented challenges and opportunities. The &amp;ldquo;Looking Forward to the Future&amp;rdquo; series of forums initiated by the top domestic journal Acta Psychologica Sinica successfully held an online academic lecture on the evening of April 28, 2024. Professor Wang was invited to be the keynote speaker. The theme was &amp;ldquo;AI Uncertainty and Psychology in the Information Age.&amp;rdquo; The lecture was chaired by Professor Fu Xiaolan, editor-in-chief of Acta Psychologica Sinica and director of the Institute of Psychology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, who also interacted with the live audience in a discussion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://eyhxg.xetslk.com/sl/3vGUA0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Lecture replay&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the lecture, Professor Wang first discussed the characteristics of the AI era, including the contradiction between massive information and human cognitive limitations, the limitations of high uncertainty and probability, the arrogance of rationality, and the limitations of scientific thinking, and the contradiction between technological progress and evolutionary design. He emphasized that psychology plays a crucial role in understanding and managing AI. Intelligent management of AI requires not only a deep understanding of AI itself but also an understanding of the differences between AI and human rationality. Professor Wang shared the empirical research results of his recent study on risk decision-making between ChatGPT and humans, and discussed in detail the similarities and differences between AI and humans in risk decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Professor Fu highly praised Professor Wang&amp;rsquo;s report and hosted a lively interactive discussion with over five thousand online audience members, further enriching the content of the lecture and providing multidimensional analysis and thinking for the intersection and integration of psychology and AI.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
The series of lectures hosted by Acta Psychologica Sinica provides an academic platform for the discussion of AI uncertainty in the field of psychology. Professor Wang&amp;rsquo;s insights provide valuable ideas for psychologists and practitioners, which will help promote the innovation and development of Chinese psychology in the AI era.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On the afternoon of April 13, 2024, Professor Wang was invited to present a special talk titled &amp;ldquo;Psychology: Integration and Intersection—My Interdisciplinary and Original Research&amp;rdquo; at the &amp;ldquo;Century of Hundred Psychologists&amp;rdquo; lecture series in China.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The series of lectures is organized by Guangxi Normal University, with the Education Department of the same university taking charge of the execution, and has received significant support and assistance from the Guangxi Normal University Press and the Guangxi Psychological Society. The aim of these lectures is to invite distinguished psychologists recognized by the Chinese Psychological Society to share their landmark achievements in the field of psychological research and discuss their academic growth and scholarly insights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the lecture, Professor Wang reviewed his academic journey, including the rich empirical experience he accumulated in both basic and applied research, and provided a perspective on the future development of the discipline. He particularly highlighted several important lines of his research, including the AA hypothesis of decisions biases,the Tri-reference point theory, the Signaling Hypothesis of Blood glucose and the Adaptive Life-span Management theory.
&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
The lecture was concluded with a summary by Professor Zhang Jijia. Professor Zhang emphasized that Professor Wang was also among the first to introduce evolutionary theory into the study of behavioral decision-making, contributing significantly to the dissemination of evolutionary psychology in China. Professor Zhang also specifically mentioned four valuable experiences in academic research: firstly, a solid disciplinary foundation is a prerequisite for integration and interdisciplinary research; secondly, profound humanistic care is an indispensable motivation for studying human behavior; thirdly, engaging in interdisciplinary and integrative research can promote academic innovation; and lastly, maintaining a sustained interest and attention to theory is key to exploring the deep-seated causes of human behavior.
Professor Wang’s talk not only showcased his profound expertise in the field of psychology and his innovative spirit in interdisciplinary research but also provided attendees with new perspectives for understanding and exploring human decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
Whether you are hesitating to buy a high-priced item on sale in a store or feeling the urge to buy a stock when it falls below your set psychological price level in the stock market, there is a common and powerful psychological phenomenon at play: the anchoring effect. It pervades our daily lives, shopping decisions, and investment behaviors. Why can the original price tag of a product attract purchases? Why do investors make irrational decisions anchored to a stock&amp;rsquo;s historical price? How can one identify and counteract this bias? This episode will reveal to you that the first number you hear can become your decision-making &amp;ldquo;anchor,&amp;rdquo; but it may not necessarily be the most rational choice.

&lt;br&gt;
The 25th National Psychology Conference opened on October 13, 2023, at Sichuan Normal University in Chengdu, Sichuan. The conference, spanning three days, featured a keynote speech by Professor Wang Xiaotian on October 14, titled &amp;ldquo;Between Life and Death: Intertemporal Decision-Making within the Framework of Life History Theory&amp;rdquo; (Conference Announcement: &lt;a href=&#34;http://nacp2023.psysoc.org.cn/%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;http://nacp2023.psysoc.org.cn/)&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract-of-the-speech&#34;&gt;Abstract of the Speech&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most economic and psychological theories share two common assumptions: the finiteness of time and the finiteness of resources. Our series of studies explore how the finiteness of time, or rather, the finiteness of life, shapes human behavior. Each individual&amp;rsquo;s interaction with time occurs within the brief or extended span of a lifetime, making it essential for psychology to focus on life histories and life history theories. Unlike other animals, human beings possess autonoetic consciousness, enabling them to consciously plan their lives within the limited time they have and make decisions accordingly. One&amp;rsquo;s worldview, encompassing their perception of time and values, is influenced not only by the perception of time but also by how they perceive and respond to two fundamental aspects of life: the inevitability of death and the uncertainty/impermanence of death. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how adjusting the inevitability and uncertainty of death within the framework of life history can impact individuals or populations&amp;rsquo; delay discounting (future discounting). I will also discuss how we use meta-analysis to compare different developmental psychological theories, generate age curves for delay discounting across the entire life history from 178 samples, and present our current research progress and related reflections.&lt;/p&gt;
