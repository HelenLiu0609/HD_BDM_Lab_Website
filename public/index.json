The aim of these lectures is to invite distinguished psychologists recognized by the Chinese Psychological Society to share their landmark achievements in the field of psychological research and discuss their academic growth and scholarly insights.\nDuring the lecture, Professor Wang reviewed his academic journey, including the rich empirical experience he accumulated in both basic and applied research, and provided a perspective on the future development of the discipline. He particularly highlighted several important lines of his research, including the AA hypothesis of decisions biases,the Tri-reference point theory, the Signaling Hypothesis of Blood glucose and the Adaptive Life-span Management theory. The lecture was concluded with a summary by Professor Zhang Jijia. Professor Zhang emphasized that Professor Wang was also among the first to introduce evolutionary theory into the study of behavioral decision-making, contributing significantly to the dissemination of evolutionary psychology in China. Professor Zhang also specifically mentioned four valuable experiences in academic research: firstly, a solid disciplinary foundation is a prerequisite for integration and interdisciplinary research; secondly, profound humanistic care is an indispensable motivation for studying human behavior; thirdly, engaging in interdisciplinary and integrative research can promote academic innovation; and lastly, maintaining a sustained interest and attention to theory is key to exploring the deep-seated causes of human behavior. Professor Wang’s talk not only showcased his profound expertise in the field of psychology and his innovative spirit in interdisciplinary research but also provided attendees with new perspectives for understanding and exploring human decision-making.\n","date":1713312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1713326344,"objectID":"8f0de7d953ffc14c2ab0713d55e5d9af","permalink":"https://hd-bdm-lab.netlify.app/invited_talks/psy/","publishdate":"2024-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/invited_talks/psy/","section":"invited_talks","summary":"On the afternoon of April 13, 2024, Professor Wang was invited to present a special talk titled \"Psychology: Integration and Intersection—My Interdisciplinary and Original Research\" at the \"Century of Hundred Psychologists\" lecture series in China.","tags":[],"title":"Professor Wang Delivers Invited Talk at the \"Century of Hundred Psychologists\" Lecture Series in China","type":"invited_talks"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1713312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1713325829,"objectID":"256e91560c235e727f30a20e1d0ee343","permalink":"https://hd-bdm-lab.netlify.app/report/","publishdate":"2024-04-17T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/report/","section":"","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Report","type":"page"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"This article is sourced from the official WeChat account of 第一财经.

The episode aired on October 23, 2023, at 10:45 PM. Whether you are hesitating to buy a high-priced item on sale in a store or feeling the urge to buy a stock when it falls below your set psychological price level in the stock market, there is a common and powerful psychological phenomenon at play: the anchoring effect. It pervades our daily lives, shopping decisions, and investment behaviors. Why can the original price tag of a product attract purchases? Why do investors make irrational decisions anchored to a stock’s historical price? How can one identify and counteract this bias? This episode will reveal to you that the first number you hear can become your decision-making “anchor,” but it may not necessarily be the most rational choice.

The 25th National Psychology Conference opened on October 13, 2023, at Sichuan Normal University in Chengdu, Sichuan. The conference, spanning three days, featured a keynote speech by Professor Wang Xiaotian on October 14, titled “Between Life and Death: Intertemporal Decision-Making within the Framework of Life History Theory” (Conference Announcement: http://nacp2023.psysoc.org.cn/). Abstract of the Speech Most economic and psychological theories share two common assumptions: the finiteness of time and the finiteness of resources. Our series of studies explore how the finiteness of time, or rather, the finiteness of life, shapes human behavior. Each individual’s interaction with time occurs within the brief or extended span of a lifetime, making it essential for psychology to focus on life histories and life history theories. Unlike other animals, human beings possess autonoetic consciousness, enabling them to consciously plan their lives within the limited time they have and make decisions accordingly. One’s worldview, encompassing their perception of time and values, is influenced not only by the perception of time but also by how they perceive and respond to two fundamental aspects of life: the inevitability of death and the uncertainty/impermanence of death. In this presentation, I will demonstrate how adjusting the inevitability and uncertainty of death within the framework of life history can impact individuals or populations’ delay discounting (future discounting). I will also discuss how we use meta-analysis to compare different developmental psychological theories, generate age curves for delay discounting across the entire life history from 178 samples, and present our current research progress and related reflections.\nSpeech Replay\n","date":1697241600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698926481,"objectID":"018d53bf064837fb297ecf76fadda6e4","permalink":"https://hd-bdm-lab.netlify.app/invited_talks/2023-10-14/","publishdate":"2023-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/invited_talks/2023-10-14/","section":"invited_talks","summary":"The 25th National Psychology Conference opened on October 13, 2023, at Sichuan Normal University in Chengdu, Sichuan.
